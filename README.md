# responsive3

- Welcome to my 2018-19 portfolio.

- The portfolio page consists of my projects mostly from my 2018 coding bootcamp. I intend to add more projects from 2019. 

- The news page uses an API from newsapi.org to receive the latest world news.

- Thank you to materializecss.com for the awesome parallex templating. I took their template and reformatted, rearranged, and inputted my own elements to create a portfolio that represents who I am!

- This portfolio uses static html rendering.
