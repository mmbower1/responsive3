Welcome to my 2018-19 portfolio.

The portfolio page consists of my projects from the past 6 months. The timers game still has some bugs, for example the timer doesn't restart correctly and the last page is not showing the win/loss score. Currently working on fixing those.

The news page has updated images from the top news from NBC. I am currently adding storylines, covers, shrinking picture sizes, and referral links to the articles.

Thank you to "Materializecss.com" for the awesome parallex templating.
