# responsive3

- Welcome to my 2018-19 portfolio.

- The portfolio page consists of my projects mostly from my 2018 coding bootcamp. I intend to add more projects from 2019. 

- The news page has updated images from the top news from NBC. I am currently adding storylines, covers, shrinking picture sizes, and referral links to the articles.

- Thank you to materializecss.com for the awesome parallex templating. I took their template and reformatted, rearranged, and inputted my own elements to create a portfolio that represents who I am!

- This portfolio uses static html rendering and uses an API to share the latest news.
